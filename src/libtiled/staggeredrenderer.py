# A staggered isometric renderer.
#
# This renderer is meant to be used with isometric tiles, but rather than
# doing a True isometric projection the tiles are shifted in order to fit
# together. This has the advantage that the map has a rectangular shape.
#
# Only one variation of staggered map rendering is supported at the moment,
# namely shifting the uneven rows to the right.
#
# Objects are handled the same way as the OrthogonalRenderer, though they
# snap at half the tile width and height.
#
# At the moment, several Tiled features will not work correctly with this
# renderer. This is due to the way the shifting messes with the coordinate
# system. List of known issues:
#
#   Fill tool:
#
#     Doesn't work properly cause its assumptions about neighboring are
#     broken by this renderer.
#
#   Stamp tool:
#
#     A stamp only makes sense if it's placed at an even y offset from
#     where it was created. When moved by an uneven y offset, the rows
#     that are shifted swap, messing up the stamp.
#
#     The circle and line drawing modes of the stamp tool won't work
#     properly due to the irregular coordinate system.
#
#   Rectangular select tool:
#
#     This one will appear to behave somewhat erratic.
#
#   Map resize and offset actions:
#
#     Similar problem as with stamps when offsetting at an uneven y offset.
