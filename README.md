About Tiled
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tiled is a general purpose tile map editor. It is meant to be used for editing
maps of any tile-based game, be it an RPG, a platformer or a Breakout clone.

Tiled is very flexible, for example there are no restrictions on map size, tile
size or the number of layers or tiles. Also, it allows arbitrary properties to
be set on the map, its layers, the tiles or on the objects. Its map format
(TMX) is relatively easy to understand and allows a map to use multiple
tilesets while also allowing each tileset to grow or shrink as necessary later.

About the Qt Version
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tiled was originally written in Java. In 2008 the Qt version was started with
the goal to replace the Java version with a faster, better looking and even
easier to use map editor. Qt offered many opportunities to improve the
performance and usability of the user interface, and has a more extensive
feature set than the standard Java libraries.
